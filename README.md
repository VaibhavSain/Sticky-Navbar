**Project Alert: Sticky Navbar Implementation**

**Project Title:** Sticky Navbar using HTML & CSS

**Date:** August 17, 2024

**Description:**
We are excited to announce the implementation of a new sticky navbar feature for our website. This enhancement is designed to improve user navigation and accessibility by keeping the navigation bar fixed at the top of the viewport as users scroll through the page.

**Key Features:**
- **Fixed Position:** The navbar remains at the top of the screen, ensuring that navigation links are always visible.
- **Responsive Design:** The sticky navbar adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience across devices.
- **Smooth Transition:** CSS transitions are used to ensure a smooth appearance and disappearance of the navbar as users scroll.

**Implementation Details:**
- **HTML:** The structure includes a `<nav>` element containing navigation links.
- **CSS:** Utilizes the `position: sticky;` property along with `top: 0;` to fix the navbar to the top of the viewport. Additional styling ensures that the navbar blends well with the overall design of the website.

**Testing:**
The feature has been tested across various browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and performance. Any issues or feedback can be reported to the development team for further refinement.

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor user feedback for any issues or improvements.
- Analyze user engagement to assess the impact of the sticky navbar on navigation efficiency.
